         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now more than time that theſe holy Sermons ſhould come to light, into the light of this World, to be themſelves a Light to the World, after ſo many
<pb facs="tcp:170480:3"/>years ſince the departure of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and Religious Author of them into the light of God.</p>
            <p>When they firſt come abroad, whom ought they earlier to greet than your noble Lordſhip? that his Poſthume Papers might crave protection from the ſame Family which gave Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage to his living Perſon.</p>
            <p>From the ſervice of the Earldom, he went up to wait upon the Throne, and yet did never forget Your <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle-Aſhby,</hi> after his arrive to the Kings <hi>White-Hall;</hi> though he was found to have merit enough to enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his attendance upon the two beſt Peers, in Chaplainry to your Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father who deſerved to be (in reſpect of the Earldom, though there was a deſerv'd, and much more ancient riſe of the noble name of the <hi>Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons) Ortus Domus ſuae</hi> (a fairer commendation than which, the quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt best-tongu'd Orator could not invent for himſelf) and in Tutor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb facs="tcp:170480:3"/>to your Father, whoſe fall was ſo valiant, that he choſe to pay a magnanimous Death, rather than to owe a beſtowed Life; though from thence, the ſame merit carried him on to do yearly homage to the two choiceſt Kings, <hi>James</hi> the wiſe, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Religious; yet he had alſo humble Gratitude enough, to confeſſe aloud, it was <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's</hi> Arm, more than his own hand and Pen, that rais'd him.</p>
            <p>My good Lord, you ſee already your just Title to the whole: But you have ſtill a more peculiar Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in theſe ſelected four. One of them was Preach'd at that Pariſh which was, all, your Ancestors, and the Authors; Nine parts yours, and the Tithes his; and Tither, of duty, it ought to return: Another, at your owne <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Nay, my moſt noble Lord, all this will not ſuffice, that you ſhould have title to theſe Compoſures, from your Progenitors, from your ſelfe, from the Author, unleſſe I humbly acknowledge the right you have in my Tranſcription too, from the claim which your Honour may lay to my very ſelfe alſo, your interest in me, your juriſdiction over me, your purchaſe of me.</p>
            <p>Your Honor had interest in me, before I was ſo happy as to ſee your Lordſhip, or ſo wiſe as to know my felf, even whilſt I was yet <hi>in Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis;</hi> for ſure our Birth is not ſo wholly wretched, as to have nothing elſe entail'd upon us at our coming into the world, beſides original ſin:

If we may adde nothing to it, 'tis already every way abſolute and perfect, the word of God without queſtion; the onely word to which we may not adde our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions without great offence: If we may take nothing from it, again 'tis a forcible Argument of the ſacred in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lableneſſe of it, (for what bold foiſting man would ever dare to ſpeak ſo arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly of the moſt Holy his own Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours? He that could write all the reſt ſo holily, could never be guilty of ſuch a pride, nor ever able to counterfeit ſo exact a Holineſſe) and that it is indeed the Holy Scripture; for it is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which Chriſt ſayes <hi>John</hi> 10. that <hi>It cannot be broken,</hi> v. 35.</p>
            <p>This is a main point obſervable, in which this Book ſtands equall'd to the ſacred unqueſtion'd Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe, the firſt and chiefe of all the Prophets, and Penmen of Gods Book; For, as thoſe Books of his, becauſe they uſher in, and are, as it were, the <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door,</hi> the <hi>entrance</hi> into the reſt of the whole Scripture, are therefore in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, ſtrengthned and fenc'd with ſuch a ſeal as this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Ye ſhall not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170480:8"/>add unto the Word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it.</hi> And again, c. 12. v. 32. <hi>Thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it:</hi> So, this Book ſtanding in the rear, and, as it were, ſhutting up the <hi>back-Gate</hi> of the ſame Canonical Scripture, is likewiſe furniſht and ſtampt with the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Seale of Gods Holy Spirit, to ſignifie how perfect, how inviolable it is, that nothing muſt be put to, no Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript; or taken from it, no <hi>Deleatur,</hi> no <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> neither; that, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was a main <hi>Coryphaeus,</hi> to lead on the Van-guard, in Gods Spiritual War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; ſo was S. <hi>John</hi> another <hi>Coryphaeus</hi> of ſpecial Note, to bring up the <hi>Rear</hi> in the ſame Battel.</p>
            <p>Why it was order'd by the Church (which took care to gather together the Writings of the Apoſtles &amp; Evangeliſts) to be plac'd the <hi>laſt</hi> of all the Books, there is a manifeſt reaſon; not that it is <hi>behinde</hi> the reſt in <hi>worth</hi> and excellence, but in regard of the <hi>Time</hi> wherein it was written.
<note place="margin">In vita Johannis.</note> S. <hi>Jerome</hi> reports, that in the time of the <hi>ſecond</hi> great Perſecution of the Chriſtians under <hi>Domitian</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperor, (the <hi>firſt</hi> Tyranny they

               <hi>John</hi> write this Book in the Iſland <hi>Pathmos:</hi> And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (a Father in the Church far more ancient than St. <hi>Jerome</hi>) affirms as much that it was not (then) long, ſince St. <hi>John</hi> wrote his <hi>Revelation, Sed pene ſub noſtro ſaeculo,</hi> ſayes he, almoſt about our time, toward the end of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign; ſo that, <hi>An.

            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:170480:9"/>
            <p>The Argument of this whole Book is,
<note place="margin">Argum.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170480:9"/>meerly from the rage and malice of their Enemies; but that God (that Winde,
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.8.</note> that Spirit which <hi>bloweth where it will</hi>) had the chiefe hand in them; and that, by his providence, things were ſo ordered for the exerciſe of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and that they ſhould not alwayes continue, no, not too long a time; and that they ſhould, in his good and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, be <hi>changed</hi> up into the glory of Heaven; and that all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church ſhould at length, by the power of Chriſt their victorious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, be thrown into the ever burning Lake of fire and brimſtone.</p>
            <p>We may divide the whole Booke (briefly,
<note place="margin">Partitio libri.</note> for I muſt not ſtand long upon this Diſcourſe; <hi>Divide</hi> it I may; I come not to <hi>expound</hi> the whole Book; and the Text it ſelfe affords matter enough for this ſhort time, though I eke it out with a borrowed part of another hour) into a Preface,
<note place="margin">Paraeus.</note> to the <hi>ninth</hi> verſe of the firſt Chapter; the Prophecy it ſelf, from thence to the <hi>ſixteenth</hi> verſe of the <hi>laſt</hi> Chapter; and from thence to the <hi>end,</hi> the Epilogue, or Concluſion.</p>
            <p>We are now in the midſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and the whole Prophecy may
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170480:10"/>be diſtinguiſhed into 7 ſeveral viſions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly diſtinct aſunder to them that read them with careful obſervation; which Chriſt was pleaſed for the future good of his Church to ſhew to his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved St. <hi>John,</hi> whilſt he lived a baniſht man in the Iſle of <hi>Pathmos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may not ſtand now to ſhew you theſe 7 Viſions, with the ſubject-matter of them: I read not a Lecture upon them all, nor upon any one, intirely: This Text is a ſmall part of the <hi>fourth Viſion,</hi> which takes up three whole Chapters, the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth: It is of the Woman travelling in birth, and the Draggon gaping to devour the fruit of her womb; of her flight into the Wilderneſſe, and his purſuit after her, reſiſted by <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels; then of the two Beaſts, one with ſeven heads and ten horns, the other with two horns like a Lamb, which ſpake as a Draggon; both perſecuting the Saints: then of the victorious Lamb, upon that Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and of the three Angels, one preaching the Goſpel, another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the fall of <hi>Babylon;</hi> a third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing puniſhment to them that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Beaſt: Laſtly, of Chriſt upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170480:10"/>the Cloud, with a ſharp ſickle in his hand, and the Angel proclaiming the laſt Harveſt of the World; and the Vintage, and Wine-preſſe of the Wrath of God: All this is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the fourth Viſion; in which the future eſtate of Gods Church in this World, even from the Infancy of it, under the Miniſtry of Chriſts Apoſtles, unto the end of the World, is far more cleerly ſhaddowed out unto us, than in the former Viſions.</p>
            <p>The third Angel begins at the 9. verſe of this Chapter, and continues to the end of the 11. Then, in the 12. and 13. verſes (part of the laſt whereof I read unto you) follows an <hi>Epiphonema</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and conſolation to the Saints of God, that in all theſe vexations with which Antichriſt ſhall grate them, they perſevere with patience and conſtancy in the faith of Chriſt, and obedience to his Goſpel; that they faint not under their tribulations, but hold out to the end, being held up with the hope of eternal felicity in Heaven, which is here propounded.</p>
            <p>The Exhortation to perſeverance is in the 12. verſe; the Argument for it is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170480:11"/>taken from that Tragical end, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and wofull event which muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall Antichriſt, and his unſound fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; that ſeeing they ſhall (at laſt) drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, and drink it off, the very dregs of it; that they ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone, and ſhall have no reſt day and night; here is <hi>the patience of the Saints, v.</hi> 12. Here is an Argument for their perſeverance, that the Holy ones of God, who keep the Commandments of God, and the ſaith of Jeſus, that they ſuffer manfully under the bittereſt Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of their Adverſaries, as knowing, that it ſhall at laſt be guerdon'd to them with the fearfull endleſneſſe of inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torments in Hell fire.</p>
            <p>Then follows the Conſolation in this verſe of my Text, <hi>And I heard a voice from Heaven, ſaying, Write, bleſſed are the Dead that die in the Lord:</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Holy Ghoſt here uſeth, to ſtrengthen and comfort them, ready now to droop under the weight of their ſufferings, is drawn from the aſſurance of (the moſt ineſtimable Reward) eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beſſedneſſe in Heaven; and that Death it ſelfe (the laſt and greateſt evil,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170480:11"/>with which the faithfull can be afflicted by their moſt deſpiting enemies) is no evil at all, for it is the ready, though ſtraight, and narrow, and ſevere Way, to the certain joy and glory of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I heard a voice from Heaven:</hi> from thence we ſee (though through a cloud, through the water of that, and the tears of our owne eyes) our comfort comes; 'Tis moſt certain, moſt true; were it the voice of God himſelfe, or of one of his Angels at his command, St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes not whether; but, the voice of Chriſt himſelfe his Sheep are ſure it is, <hi>they know his voice;</hi> the ſame in effect which we have heard from him before, in his holy Goſpel more than once, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that hears my Words, and believes on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation: There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt, (Rom.</hi> 8.1.) and there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too to them, in the ears of whoſe Souls are the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and in <hi>John</hi> 8.51. (not without another and another) a double <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you</hi> (to caſt off all doubt) <hi>If a man
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170480:12"/>keep my ſaying, he ſhall nevtr ſee death,</hi> the eternall, the curſed death: The very ſame, to all purpoſes that this Voice ſayes here; <hi>Write, bleſſed are the dead, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three things obſervable in this Voice from Heaven;
<note place="margin">Diviſio Verſus.</note> firſt, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Write.</hi> Chriſt will not put his Church to truſt to the uncertainty, the deceivableneſs of unwritten Traditions: but, as in the beginning, there was a generall command for the writing of this whole Prophecy, <hi>Write,</hi> ſayes Chriſt to the Prophet St. <hi>John</hi> chap. 1. v. 19. <hi>Write the things which thou haſt ſeen, and the things which are, and the things which ſhall be hereafter,:</hi> ſo has he, here again, a ſpecial command for the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this heavenly voice, concerning the bleſſedneſſe of them who die in the Lord; he will have our comfort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to us here, as the Divel's ſeveral ſuggeſtions were rejected and confuted by himſelfe,
<note place="margin">Matt. 4.</note> with a <hi>Scriptum eſt;</hi> the Scripture, the written Word of God, ſhall be the ground, as of our Faith, ſo of our Hope, our incouragement and conſolation through that Faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Argument, the ſubſtance of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170480:12"/>what he is commanded to deliver to the Church by writing, bleſſedneſſe. And thirdly, the aſſurance and proofe of this bleſſedneſſe by two ſtrong Reaſons; one, that they are now gotten to the end of their Race, that they enjoy a perpetual reſt from all the labours and ſufferings which they have ſuſtained under the Sun, <hi>they reſt from their labours;</hi> and the other, that they have <hi>ſo run</hi> as to <hi>obtain;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.24.</note> that having <hi>finiſht their courſe,</hi> they have not <hi>reſt</hi> onely, but their <hi>Brabium,</hi> their <hi>Crown</hi> alſo, which was <hi>laid up for them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.7, 8.</note> their Crown of <hi>righteouſneſſe, their works do follow them;</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Metalepſis,</hi> a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpeech, as much as to ſay, the <hi>fruit</hi> of their Works, the Reward, the Crown of their Righteouſneſſe, which was laid up in Heaven, is given to them by the Lord the righteous Judge <hi>at that day,</hi> the day of their death, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</p>
            <p>That which is the Argument of this Scripture, is now our Text, and muſt be anon the Argument of our Diſcourſe, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead,</hi> a moſt ſweet and comfortable Argument, a Theme (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) full of gracious ſolace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to arm the faithfull againſt the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170480:13"/>evil day, that of death, that it is not, as the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Sect of Philoſophers taught, <hi>Extrema linea rerum,</hi> the end of all our being; that when the <hi>body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the earth as it was made,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> does not ſo too, but <hi>unto God who gave it, Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. that we are not <hi>born at all adventure, and ſhall be hereafter as though we had never been,</hi> as thoſe <hi>ungodly fools</hi> dream'd, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 2.2. that the <hi>breath</hi> of our noſtrils are not as <hi>ſmoak,</hi> and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>ſpark</hi> in the moving of our heart, which being <hi>extinguiſhed</hi> our body ſhall be turned into <hi>aſhes,</hi> and our <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſhall vaniſh as the ſoft <hi>aire:</hi> They taught ill, and their Diſciples, the <hi>Sadduces</hi> learn'd as ill from them, that there is <hi>no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Act.</hi> 23.8. No, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be preach'd that he roſe from the dead, we may ask S. <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtion, <hi>How ſay ſome among you, that there is no reſurrection of the dead?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. And. <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable, v.</hi> 19. but we are therefore miſerable in this life, that at our death we may be bleſſed, as my Text hath it, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of which, to fit you to the more profitable hearing of what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170480:13"/>ſhall be delivered, let me put you in minde of the Wiſe mans counſel, <hi>Eeclus.</hi> 7.36. <hi>Remember the end,</hi> (the laſt things) <hi>and thou ſhalt not do amiſſe:</hi> There are <hi>Quatuor noviſſima,</hi> four things, which do, laſt, befall the ſtate of man, Death, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Bleſſedneſſe in Heaven, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Hell: Theſe would be often thought on, and duly conſider'd by us, as a moſt ſoveraign Antidote againſt the Infections of this world, a pretious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt Sin; Death, which muſt bring us to Judgment; Judgment, which muſt either convey us to Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bliſſe, or condemn us to eternal reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe miſery; there is the bleſſedneſſe of the Saints in Heaven, to inflame our hearts with a holy deſire after it; and the wretched ſtate of the damned in Hell, to make us wiſe and wary for the avoyding of it: 'Tis a rule of St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom's</hi> that we ſhould be ſo, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thereupon to aſcape it, <hi>Non ſinet in Gehennam incidere, Gehennae meminiſſe,</hi> the awfull thinking of it, will keep us from falling into it. Theſe are the <hi>Quatuor noviſſima,</hi> the four laſt things, which the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> would have ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in our memories, with <hi>a Pen of Iron,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:170480:14"/>and with the <hi>point of a Diamond,</hi> to keep us from doing aniſſe; <hi>Memorare noviſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> Remember the end, and thou ſhalt not do amiſſe.</p>
            <p>Within the compaſſe of this ſhort Text,
<note place="margin">Diviſio Textus.</note> we have two of theſe four laſt things to imploy our thoughts upon, Death and Bleſſedneſſe; Death, which all men by nature fear; Bleſſedneſſe, which all men by that ſame inſtinct, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; and therefore no man living, but this Text concerns him; no man, but may reap profit from the Doctrine it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords: That's two-fold; in the unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and applying of which, I intreat your attention and devotion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Death,</hi> though in it ſelfe it be bitter and terrible, yet, to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it is ſo ſweetned by Chriſt, that, in them, 'tis made the way to bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.80.</note> 
               <hi>This is the Gate of Heaven, and the Righteous ſhall enter in thereby: The Dead are bleſſed that die in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Bleſsedneſſe,</hi> though it be ſo ſweet a thing, the object of all mens deſires, ſo generally aim'd at by all men in their ſeverall endeavours, yet, all our life time here we come ſhort of it, we attain it not till our death; <hi>Dicique
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170480:14"/>beatus antiobitum nemo; nemo,</hi> before that; and not <hi>omnes</hi> after, not all of us then, but they only, who die in the Lord: <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deſire firſt to faſten your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon <hi>Death,</hi> which is the way to bleſſedneſſe; and (to <hi>keep the beſt wine till the laſt</hi>) in the ſecond place, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh you with the Meditation of Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which inſueth upon death.</p>
            <p>Nor will this former diſcourſe,
<note place="margin">Praefatio ad partem primam.</note> as it is pertinent to the buſineſſe we are now upon, the death of that Worthy and Right Honorable Patriot of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey (for whom wiſe men religiouſly mourn in a Sermon, as witty men uſed to lament for Heathens in an Elegy) be needleſſe and ſuperfluous to thoſe that live; ſince the often taking occaſion (as it is now moſt unhappily for us, and moſt bleſſedly for him whom we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, offer'd by that God who hath taken him from us to himſelfe) to ſix the eyes of our minde upon the end of our life, is ſo behoovefull, that even <hi>Plato,</hi> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſopher, but admirable for wit and learning, found ſuch a benefit of it, that he defin'd <hi>Wiſdome</hi> to be the

               <hi>Meditation of death;</hi> and though, in that, he aim'd not, as we do, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to the often thinking upon it, (for, difinitions are the Common-Place of one ſort of Learning, the ſpeculative and perſwaſions of another, the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call) yet, in this reſpect eſpecially, may we more truly affirm it than he did, that it is a great part of wiſdome to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome our ſelves often to the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death: and howſoever the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, that great enemy of Mankinde, does, for his own ends, and the readier advancement and enlarging of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, labour by all means, to lull us into ſecurity, by the pleaſures of this World, and to ſteal out of our thoughts the remembrance of our death, that ſo our death may ſteal upon us at <hi>unawares, Luke</hi> 21.34. and take us unprovided; to make us, <hi>ducere in bonis dies noſtros,</hi> to ſpend our dayes in jollity, that we may go down to the Grave <hi>in a moment, Job</hi> 21.13. yet the Spirit of God directs us a ſafer courſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.8. <hi>If a man live many years and rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkneſſe:</hi> There is danger when death ſteals upon us (Oh then we have loſt that bleſſing of our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170480:15"/>Text, which the ſoul of this our dear Father departed, hath found! 'Tis a Curſe, <hi>let death come haſtily;</hi> and ſure 'tis lawfull to pray as we do in our Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, againſt a <hi>Curſe, from ſudden death good Lord deliver us</hi>) when we have not made our ſelves acquainted with it, and digeſted in our thoughts, the worſt that it can do; then is it true indeed that S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath fore-warn'd us, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.2. that <hi>the day of the Lord commeth as a Thief in the night:</hi> Then, <hi>as the Fiſhes that are taken in an evil Net, and as the Birds,

            <p>Firſt therefore we conſider, how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how fearfull, and terrible a thing death is in it ſelfe to all mankinde, and how grievous it continues to the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man.

            <p>'Tis a ſtrong and violent breach of one of the goodlieſt Frames of Nature, (for I ſpeak ſtill of the Natural man) when the Soul is inforc'd from the body; we hear not without a ſecret compaſſion the forſaken Oxe bemoaning his owne loſſe, with his lowing, when his Fellow, that had long drawn with him in the ſame yoke, is haled from him to the ſlaughter.

            <p>Think, when a man and wife who have ſpent much time together in that near tie of love and mutual ſociety, ſhall at laſt be parted by that violent neceſſity, and unkind ſtroke of death, what a heart-breaking it muſt be to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to have the wife of his boſome, whom his ſoul lov'd ſo tenderly, to be rent from his ſide by that Iron-hand of diſſolution; now all his joyes leave him, and he <hi>refuſeth to be comforted, becauſe ſhe is not:</hi> And then, think withall what a ſad divorce this muct needs prove be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſoul and the body, who have liv'd long together in a ſtrict neerneſſe of affection, as greater cannot be; when the ſoul muſt leave the body, his ſo dear Conſort, to which he gave life, and form'd a better being; when he muſt be forc'd to take into his conſideration the miſerable condition that then attends either of them: firſt for the body, that it muſt, after a few hours, be ſhut up in a dark and loathſome Grave, and be made food for Worms and Toads; that body which now lives and breathes, and

            <p>But then, to imagine the ſtate of the Soul which has not hope in Chriſt (for we are in Nature yet) to think of that <hi>Incognita,</hi> that new Region, unknown to any living Wight, whither it muſt now travel naked and unaccompanied, ſave with the horror of his gnawing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to labour to conceive thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable woes of that other world, and to comprehend that incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eternity of them, 'tis wonder he can live a moment to digeſt that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtible thought; 'tis a wonder that the terror of it does not prevent the hand and ſythe of his approaching death, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170480:19"/>it does not anticipate his fate, and prove more quick to dead him, more nimble than his diſeaſe to ſtrike and ſlay his ſoul: For one to be taken from his wealth, pleaſure, honour, friends, wife, children; to leave theſe outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentfull things makes death bitter to him; 'tis another death, This <hi>O mors quàm amara eſt memoria tuis!</hi> 'tis the <hi>Wiſe-mans</hi> exclamation, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 41.1. <hi>O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee, to a man that liveth at reſt in his poſſeſſions, that hath nothing to vex him, that hath proſpepity in all things!</hi> The ſeparation that is made betwixt him and his world, afflicts him; but the ſeparation betwixt him and himſelfe (his ſoul and his body) is intollerable; how loathly it leaves that old companion? how loathly it goes out of that beloved dwelling! St. <hi>Hierome</hi> writes the life of <hi>Hilarion,</hi> a good Chriſtian, a devout and holy man, one that feared God, and in moſt of his life ſo little feared death, that he deſired nothing more, than to be <hi>diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt:</hi>

            <p>Beloved, have you look'd enough up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death in his worſt ſhape? and can ye collect how terrible he muſt needs appear to the wicked, over whom he hath full power? ſince, even to Gods holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, out of a natural deſire to preſerve their being, ſince, even to Gods belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, when to ſhew himſelfe truly man, he was content to yield ſo ſar to the ſway of humane nature within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he ſeem'd ſo odious, that in the preſence of ſome of his Apoſtles, he did not let to diſcover his paſſion, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowfull, even unto death, Matt.</hi> 26.38.
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.44.</note> to pray to his Father <hi>thrice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and, but that the will of his Father was in the midſt of his bowels, and his obedience ſtronger than death, he would have begg'd three times more, that the <hi>Cup</hi> might have <hi>paſs'd from him;</hi> ſo odious, that for the comfort of the Elect, 'tis one of the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings betroath'd to them in the New <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> that, <hi>there ſhall be no more death,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170480:20"/>Rev.</hi> 21.4. Then now cheer up your thoughts again by faith in Chriſt, and with that eye of faith, behold death vanquiſht by that Chriſt, behold him trampled under thoſe victorious feet, ſo languiſhing, ſo dead himſelfe, that he cannot hurt you, he cannot ſcare you.</p>
            <p>This is the ſecond conſideration of death,
<note place="margin">Mors Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Coeli.</note> that how evil ſoever it be in it ſelfe, even the way to Hell, yet, by Gods goodneſſe it is become a Portal to the Children of Grace, by which the ſoul paſſeth out of the miſeries of this life into the joyes of Heaven; even the <hi>dead</hi> are <hi>bleſſed,</hi> that <hi>die in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God made not Death, Wiſdome</hi> 1.13. <hi>through the envy of the Divel it came into the world, Wiſd.</hi> 2.24. 'tis he that was the <hi>Murderer from the beginning,</hi> Joh. 8.44. Murderer of our bodies and of our ſouls too, death of both is his work, 'tis he that has the <hi>power of death;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.14</note> and if <hi>only the body</hi> di'd, he would ſoon diſown the name, and diſvalue all the power he had: Now wherefore came Chriſt into the world? wherefore was he manifeſted in the fleſh? why, for this purpoſe ſayes S. <hi>John, ut diſſolvat opera, that he might
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170480:21"/>deſtroy the works of the Divel,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. He took part of our fleſh and blood; why? that he might die; without that he could not die; the Godhead is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and why die? but, <hi>that through his death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, the Divel, Heb.</hi> 2.14. So truly might he ſay of himſelfe, <hi>John</hi> 10.10. <hi>I am come, that they might have life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was it which was prophecyed ſo long ſince, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. <hi>O mors, ero mors tua: O death, I will be thy death, thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy deſtruction;</hi> the Prophecy is not yet fulfill'd, if we read that place as the Vulgar Edition hath it, <hi>I will be thy death;</hi> Death ſhall be deſtroyd indeed, but not yet, 'tis the <hi>laſt enemy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.26.</note> that muſt be deſtroyd; but if we read it, as we have well tranſlated it, <hi>O death, I will be thy plagues,</hi> 'tis every day fulfill'd in that glorious victory, with which ſo many of the Saints of God, at their diſſolution, do triumph over it; Chriſt does not take away death, but the evil of death; not the being, but the ſting of it; as, whilome he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Eſau</hi> to meet his <hi>Jacob,</hi> but firſt he drave all enmity out of the heart of that <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 33.4.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:170480:21"/>
            <p>This is one degree of the change, which Chriſt has wrought in the nature of death to his Servants, that it hath no power over them to hurt them; they ſhall not be hurt of this <hi>ſecond</hi> death, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.11. who overcome the <hi>firſt,</hi> that of the ſoul by ſin; conquer that by Faith, and thou ſubdueſt the fear of this, <hi>He that believeth in me, though he were dead yet ſhall he live, John</hi> 11 25. he ſhall chaunt out S. <hi>Pauls</hi> triumph, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy victory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is one degree, but this is not all; 'tis not enough to make us bleſſed, that death hurts us not; it muſt be forc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the own nature of it, to help us; it is a part, as being a means, of our happineſſe, that we die; <hi>Thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickened, except it die,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.36. ſo that the very blow we receive from this hard hand, is heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that which our ſin made to be our <hi>laſt enemy,</hi> the goodneſſe of God hath made the <hi>firſt friend</hi> that we meet with in our paſſage to another world.</p>
            <p>When a child ſees a goodly cluſter of ripe Grapes, he thinks it pity to put them into the preſſe, and to deface
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170480:22"/>them; but the skilfull man knows, that this hard uſage preſerves the liquor of them from corruption: we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times theſe ignorant children; we think it pity that ſuch a holy, devout, religious good man ſhould die; alas, he can be ill ſpared, yet God in his wiſdome, makes this man, thus ripe for heaven, the more happy by death it ſelfe; <hi>he fals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground, that he may bring forth much fruit, Jo.</hi> 12.24.</p>
            <p>This is the true ground, beloved, of all our ſpirituall rejoycing upon our Death-bed, that we know we leave this, for an infinitely better life, that we can ſay with the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.21</note> 
               <hi>Mori mihi lucrum,</hi> we <hi>gain</hi> by this change: That we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no hurt by death; that it is, at the worſt, but a ſleep, in which we reſt from our labours, this is much; but that we ſhould reap profit and honour, that the <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſſe</hi> is layd up for us, that the <hi>reward of our works</hi> doth follow us: this is all; this is the very bleſſedneſſe of the dead that die in the Lord.</p>
            <p>The former is ſufficient to inforce the Apoſtles Exhortation, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.13. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them who are aſleep, that we

If any man could have found a life wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be prefer'd unto death, ſo wiſe, great, and glorious a King muſt needs have done it; and yet he, in his very <hi>Throne,</hi> commends his <hi>Coffin</hi> above his Scepter, and would rather chooſe to be a ſubject for worms to feed upon, than a Prince of men: This makes us no more to marvel at thoſe Heathens, who mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the birth, and feaſted at the death of their children; and yet alas, they had not halfe the cauſe, that we have, of rejoycing; they knew ſome of the miſeries that accompanied this life, what troubles, and cares, and anxieties, and wants men paſſed through, what croſſes and calamities they indure here,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170480:23"/>which are the puniſhments of ſin; but ſin it ſelfe, the greateſt burden of this life, the ſoreſt evil that waits upon, and makes it moſt weariſome, this <hi>malum culpae,</hi> this evil of ſin, they were not, as they ought, aware of; and yet they were ſo affected with the feeling of thoſe other ills, that they made merry at the death of their friends, out of a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conceit they had, that they then ceaſed to be miſerable.</p>
            <p>We know what they did, and more; we underſtand the wretchedneſſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in this vale of tears; and we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what cauſes it, the ſnares of ſin, from which we are looſed, when we are freed out of the priſon of this body, <hi>he that is dead,

            <p>Well, If the conſideration of this be ſo behoovefull to us for the withdrawing of our Souls from ſin (for which purpoſe I have thus long chafed your memories to the due meditation of it) the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the other can be no leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoovefull for the inkindling our ſouls after glory; for which purpoſe I muſt entreat a new attention and devotion in you.</p>
            <p>I will not be ſtill preſuming upon ſo much time,
<note place="margin">Beatitudo</note> as I ſhall need to ſpeak of <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> at large, and to diſcourſe, as the true nature of it, ſo the manifold errors of others about it; nor does my Text require it: There is no man but has, by nature, ſome kind of knowledge of it, that it is the beſt and choiſeſt thing that can be, and as <hi>Boetius</hi> defines it, an eſtate made perfect by the enjoying of all good things; which, who ſo has obtained, he is fully ſatisfied; he ſeeks, he deſires, he wiſhes nothing more: But what that is, in the poſſeſſion whereof this happineſſe conſiſts, and which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doweth a man with this perfect eſtate,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170480:25"/>that has ever been a thing ſo difficult and obſcure to the moſt learned ages of old Heatheniſm, that there is no one queſtion has bred ſuch perplexity and differenee in opinions amongſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philoſophers; ſome placing it in knowledge, ſome, in vertue, ſome, in plenty, ſome, in pleaſure; I cannot, I liſt not, I need not name them all: St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tels us,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Civit. l.</hi> 19. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> the learned <hi>Varro</hi> has obſerv'd, that Philoſophers have wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled about this point, to the number of 288 different opinions; not to trouble you with the relation of them.</p>
            <p>That which I propound to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, briefly, is that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. True bleſſedneſſe is a thing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſired of all men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That notwithſtanding this ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deſire, it is never fully obtain'd by any man till his death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And then, not by all men, but by thoſe only who die in the Lord, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead, who die in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That every one man does,
<note place="margin">Votum omnium.</note> in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, aim at bleſſedneſſe, no one man will deny; ſo little need there is to prove it; ask every man by the poll, if he would be bleſſed? ye know his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170480:26"/>before-hand; we are all alike born with that deſire in us; nor is there any thing which we do at any time, in which we have not a cloſe purpoſe to bleſſe our ſelves; in every humane action there is an end propounded for which we work; not the <hi>finis cujus,</hi> the end of the action; as, when a man giveth over to work; but the <hi>finis cui,</hi> the end, for which he worketh: as, he that ſtudieth, he ſtudieth to this end, that he may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge; and the Merchant that traffiques, he trades to this end, that he may grow rich; and the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, that ſerves and flatters, he does it to this end, that he may get into ſome place; this <hi>end</hi> is the beginning in every of our actions; 'tis <hi>primum in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentione,</hi> as the Philoſopher ſpeaks, the firſt thing in our intentions; that which ſets us at work: and when we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to our ſelves, that we will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve knowledge, or riches, or honour, then we betake our ſelves to ſuch actions as we think to be the means for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, as ſtudy, or merchandize, or ſervile flattery, the practiſe of the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Paraſite, as, of the ingenuous minde, to high actions of vertue.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:170480:26"/>
            <p>Now that which is the <hi>finis ultimus,</hi> the laſt end of all, that which all men, in their ſeveral projects aim at, as their Maſter-prize, and upſhot of all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, is agreed on by all ſides, to be bleſſedneſſe: He that ſtudies to be ſuch, either he falſely places true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in that, or elſe by that he thinks to compaſs ſome higher degree of being happy: He that labors for a quiet and retired life, either he believes that to be the only happy eſtate, or elſe hopes by that to make way to a ſetled happineſſe: Men may diverſly erre in their opinions, either concerning what is true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or concerning what is the true way to it; but happily, bleſſed they would be; they know, to be bleſſed, is to be beſt; therefore they deſire nothing ſo earneſtly as that; no, nothing at all, but what they think to be a means to that; but that they deſire only for its own ſake, as being the moſt perfect good, in reſpect whereto, all other good is imperfect, and ſubordinate; and that being purchaſt, nothing can be wanted or wiſh'd for by the boundleſſe thoughts of Man.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To take away all ſcruple, 'tis an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable truth, that S. <hi>Gregory Nyſcen</hi> hath in his book <hi>De Beatitud.</hi> that God in himſelfe is <hi>Verè Beatus,</hi> moſt properly bleſſed, as having it in, and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himſelfe; and that from him, as from a Fountain, it iſſues forth upon Angels and Men, who are bleſſed in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of it, which they receive from him: Such as is the difference between the face of man which God made, and his Picture drawn by an earthly skilfull hand; though this be too diſtant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it, yet 'tis the beſt we can light upon; there the prime and true beauty is in the living face; and the ſecond, the reſemblance, the counterfeit of it in his image: ſo here, the moſt excelling bleſſedneſſe is in the Deity it ſelfe, and the next from him, upon thoſe creatures of his, who were <hi>facti ad ſimilitudinem
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170480:31"/>ejus,</hi> made after his <hi>likeneſſe,</hi> and are his <hi>Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is true Bleſſedneſſe, in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to us; but to us, how? no otherwiſe than as he is applied unto us, and we conjoyn'd unto him, which act of joyning us unto him, and applying him unto us, is that which is called <hi>Fruitio,</hi> or <hi>Viſio Dei,</hi> when we perfectly enjoy him by our ſight of him, and ſee him as he is: This is that act, which is our <hi>formall</hi> bleſſedneſſe; For God, though he be bleſſedneſſe, yet he is not <hi>formally</hi> in us, but <hi>objectivè,</hi> as the School ſpeaks, or <hi>effectivè:</hi> That which makes us formally bleſſed, is the ſight of his glorious countenance; that which makes us, thus like to him, is, that we ſee him as he is; <hi>His ſervants ſhall ſee his face, and his name ſhall be in their foreheads, Revel.</hi> 22.3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Now can this be the portion of any living man, to ſee his face? this which was denied to <hi>Moſes,</hi> his ſo beloved Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to whom he had ſaid, <hi>I know thee by name, and thou haſt found grace in my ſight, Exod.</hi> 33.12. (grace in it, but not the ſight it ſelfe) yet to him, <hi>Thou canſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170480:31"/>not ſee my face;</hi> no, <hi>no man ſhall ſee me and live, v.</hi> 20. if not ſee his face and live, then, not that true bleſſedneſſe which conſiſts in that ſight while we live: There is a meaſure of ſeeing God in this life; and ſo a meaſure of happineſs; but neither full; we ſee God in his workes; <hi>O come hither, and behold the works of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 46.8. And, <hi>Theſe ſee the workes of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 107.24. And, <hi>Behold the goodneſſe and ſeverity of God, Rom.</hi> 11.22. This is, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſee the <hi>back parts</hi> of <hi>Jehovah, Exod.</hi> 33.23. to behold him in his workes, of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and Juſtice, and Goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>So then, there is a cleer and open ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Creator, that true beatifical Viſion, which the bleſſed Saints and Angels in Heaven only enjoy; and there is a weaker ſight, a more obſcure glimpſe of the Deity, which only the ſervants of God have here by faith; they, and none elſe; neither Heathen, who are not called to the knowledge of God, nor wicked men, who reſiſt the Grace of God calling them, who do not open to him when he knocks, nor yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the good motions of his Spirit; theſe ſee him not at all; <hi>They have eyes,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170480:32"/>but ſee not;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 13.14.</note> at moſt, <hi>ſeeing they ſee, but do not perceive;</hi> the eye of their mind is ſo wholly darkned, that it is, and they are, darkneſſe it ſelfe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels the Epheſians before they were called to the light of grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. Now, if the eye of thy winde, <hi>if the light that is in thee be darkneſſe, how great is that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Matth.</hi> 6.23. And, can darkneſſe it ſelfe ſee? ſo great a darkneſſe, ſee God himſelfe! him <hi>whom eye hath not ſeen!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 64.4.</note> He is ſeen, but by one of theſe two wayes; cleerly, by them in heaven, and ſub-obſcurely, by his on earth; we have ground for them both in one verſe of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Now we ſee through a glaſſe, darkly; but then, face to face:</hi> juſt the ſame that I told you from 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>We ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, we are bleſſed here, onely in that we hope we ſhall be bleſſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; and that hope of bleſſedneſſe is grounded upon the hope we have, that we ſhall ſee God face to face: <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. why? <hi>they ſhall ſee God;</hi> they are bleſſed becauſe they ſhall be bleſſed: This was the ground of <hi>Job's</hi> happineſſe while he liv'd, in regard whereto, death and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170480:32"/>deſtruction could not hurt him; <hi>Though after my skin, worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, Job</hi> 19.26. This was it that made <hi>David</hi> bleſſed here, and was ſuch a preſervative to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fainting in the midſt of all his troubles; <hi>I ſhould utterly have fainted, but that I believe verily to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord:</hi> where? <hi>in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Pſal.</hi> 27.15. So that the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which we have here, conſiſts in the hope, that we ſhall be bleſſed in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Without ſalvation no perfect bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that's ſure; but, <hi>we are ſaved by hope, Rom.</hi> 8.24. and we are bleſſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by hope, whilſt here we live; <hi>neither is revealed yet, the glory that ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed;</hi> ſo the Apoſtle cals it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. for, <hi>what a man ſeeth, why doth he yet hope for? v.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>I hope we may now conclude this point with that ſaying of the wiſe-man, <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 11.28. <hi>Judge no man bleſſed before his death;</hi> for, before bleſſed he ſhall be, die he muſt ſayes our Text; Bleſſedneſſe is firſt, in the order of the words; but, in the order of nature, death; and with that exhortation of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170480:33"/>the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> which follows upon the confidence he had that he ſhould <hi>ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the land of the living, Pſal.</hi> 27. that, for bleſſedneſſe ſake we would not ruſh upon death, as ſome Heathens, being taught the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoul, caſt themſelves and their ſouls away, that they might be immortal; but rather, <hi>Tarry the Lords leiſure; be ſtrong, and he ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy heart; and put thy truſt</hi> (thy hope) <hi>in the Lord:</hi> Let none, by their impatience to bear a leſſe miſery, rid themſelves into a greater; whoever he be that can ſpeak with that <hi>Emphaſis, I am the man that have ſeen affliction, Lam.</hi> 3.1. and does therefore with <hi>Job</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the day of his birth,

            <p>If we will know what this is,
<note place="margin">Mori in Domino</note> to die in the Lord, and who they be that ſo do, we muſt firſt underſtand what it is, to be in the Lord while we live; for, even then this happineſſe begins in us, when we begin to be in Chriſt; <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.1. If no condemnation, then no wrath of God; if not that, then Grace and Love, and Favour; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſalvation, and eternal life; Man is no indifferent thing to his Maker; if he does not hate, he loves; nay, the very
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170480:35"/>earth upon which Man is, God does ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bleſſe it with encreaſe, or curſe it with barrenneſſe; and the Lord of the earth (under the Lord of Heaven) Man, much more: and no leſſe than this is the effect of Gods love to Mankinde; <hi>God ſo loved the World, John</hi> 3.16. So, how? <hi>even to everlaſting life, v.</hi> the ſame. Now what it is, thus uncondemnedly, to be in Chriſt? we have it explained, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believes on him is not condemned:</hi> ſo, in the verſe before, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh,</hi> 16. Not be condemned! not periſh! what them! <hi>he ſhall have life everlaſting:</hi> that's the effect of Gods love; that's the conſequent of Gods not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: So then, to be in Chriſt, is to be in the love of God, and faith of Chriſt, to cleave unto him, and rely upon him; then are we, by his Holy Spirit, ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into him; made his members, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually joyn'd unto him, and live in him.</p>
            <p>There is a general conjunction, which all men living have with the Son of God, in that he took upon him our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature; not the fleſh of man, but of mankinde; <hi>Foraſmuch as the Children

But this conjunction which is ſo general with all men, does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make all men to be in him; we are thus conjoyned with him, as I may ſay, only in regard of the <hi>matter;</hi> and to ſay ſooth, all this notwithſtanding, there is a great disjunction betwixt him and us, and the nature of men, as of men, does much differ from that nature which the Son of God took upon him; that Humane Nature of his (now with him in Heaven) is of it ſelfe immortal, without ſpot or ſtain, free from all ſin, adorned with all holineſſe, and purity, and the fulneſſe of all excellent graces; ours is impure and unholy, and wofully ſubject to corruption, becauſe miſerably defiled with ſin; we are <hi>conceived in ſin,</hi>

            <p>This our ſo near conjunction with Chriſt, and being in him, the Apoſtle hath fitly expreſs'd (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.) by a Graft grafted into a Plant, by which reſemblance is fully made good what I have ſaid concerning the nearneſſe of a Chriſtian to Chriſt by faith, and his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual living in him; in as much as the Graft, and the Plant are now made both one thing; not only one and the ſame matter, which before was different, and two, the one a good Olive-tree, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilde; but further, that the ſame ſap alſo does nouriſh all, and the ſame ſpirit gives life and growth to all, and all this by faith, as <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>becauſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, they were broken off,</hi> the natural branches, the Jewes, <hi>Tu vero fide, but thou ſtandeſt by faith;</hi> thou <hi>ſtandeſt,</hi> as he that tels thee ſo, S. <hi>Paul lived, by the faith of the Son of God, Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>

Now the branch (who knowes not) lives in the Vine, has the ſame life common with it, ſprouts and ſprings forth from the ſame power within; and we, as that, muſt bring forth the fruits of the ſame ſpirit: For, deceive we not our ſelves, beloved, 'tis not enough to profeſſe Chriſt outwardly, to ſay we believe in him; this does not prove us to be ingrafted into him, no more than the bramble was therefore King, becauſe <hi>it ſaid unto the Trees, If in truth ye annoint me King, Judg.</hi> 9.15. this was only <hi>ſaid;</hi> there was no <hi>truth</hi> in it, therefore there was no truth in it, becauſe of that other truth which Chriſt hath ſaid, that <hi>of a Bramble-buſh men do not gather Grapes, Luke</hi> 6.44. becauſe it is altogether fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: But if we do indeed and in truth cleave unto Chriſt, by a true and lively faith, an effectual and operative faith, a faith working by love, and bringing forth the fruits of good Works, then be ſure we are in him; <hi>The branch cannot bear of it ſelfe, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>except ye

            <p>THe whole Hiſtory of this buſineſs is not long to be read unto you, that you may better conceive the occaſion of theſe words: 'Tis recorded by three of the Evangeliſts; ſo worthy a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170480:42"/>paſſage it was thought by them not to be omitted; but in feweſt words by S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew:</hi> he concludes it in three ſhort ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, almoſt as ſhort as ſweet; pleaſe you hear it.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he ſhould put his hands on them, and pray; and the Diſciples rebuked them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>But Jeſus ſaid, Suffer little Children, and forbid them not, to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; for, of ſuch is the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And he laid his hands on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which ſhort Hiſtory there are three ſeveral parts acted: The firſt, by them who brought the children, the Parents, in all probability: Chriſt had, now, for the ſpace of three years, travelled about that Countrey of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> helping and healing; <hi>he went about,</hi> ſaies S. <hi>Peter, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, and healing all, Acts</hi> 10.38. For this the people magnified him, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him: but the Prieſts and the Phariſees (they eſpecially of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) were mad with anger and indignation, to ſee a ſtranger ſo go in ſtrength of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Repute amongſt them, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170480:42"/>the eſteem which the people had of <hi>them,</hi> daily to decreaſe: This drives them to a conſultation (what pity it is, ſo holſome a word ſhould be infected by their conſpiracy!) for to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and to cenſure whoſoever ſhould acknowledge him to be the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> The <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> in the mean while, beſtirs himſelfe (he knowes he has not much time,) through <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Galilee,</hi> to bid a farewel to his Auditors, whom he had lately foretold of his paſſion and death: They, poor ſouls, hearing they were like to loſe him, and having had good trial of his miraculous power, and what good they had received from him, by the <hi>impoſition</hi> of his <hi>hands,</hi> and by his <hi>prayer,</hi> now therefore as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he hears his old Father <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſick, makes haſte to bring his yong ſons unto him, that he may lay his hands on them, and they may partake of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ere he leaves them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.1. ſo theſe here come, with their babes i'their arms, that they alſo may receive ſome benediction from him before his laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, that he ſhould <hi>lay his hands on them,</hi> ſaies the Text, <hi>and pray:</hi> That was their part.</p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:170480:43"/>
            <p>The next part was acted by the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; but not ſo well; they were out i'their part, nothing like the Diſciples of ſuch a Maſter; we cannot here ſay of them as he of <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> his Scholar, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Chriſti Diſcipulos poſſis agnoſcere:</hi> They whom he had entertained for that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſake ſpecially; to be <hi>Fiſhers of men:</hi> to get all into their nets; to draw all to him; they muſt be the forwardeſt to make them ſtand back, to forbid their approach; I, to rebuke them that brought them; who did, in this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duty of Diſciples better than they?</p>
            <p>But now enters the beſt Actor i'this Scene; he ſpake, <hi>Never man ſpake like this man, John</hi> 7.46. he put <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> into his words; <hi>the words that I ſpake unto you,</hi> ſaies himſelfe, <hi>they are ſpirit, and they are life,</hi> 6.63. and his <hi>ſpeech</hi> was not without <hi>action,</hi> they go together in this ſtory; a comfortable ſpeech, a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble action; <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, &amp;c.</hi> there is his ſpeech; <hi>he laid his hands on them:</hi> S. <hi>Mark</hi> tels what he did more; <hi>he took them up in his arms, put his hands on them, and bleſſed them, Mark</hi> 10.16. that's his action.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:170480:43"/>
            <p>Of all theſe we have only the laſt and beſt Actor to intend at this time; and in him, if we can make good uſe of his ſpeech alone, 'twill be an hour well ſpent; ſo much was the Text read at firſt, <hi>Suffer little children to come, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Chriſts general command,
<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>believing</hi> Parents (for ſuch were theſe, and of ſuch he ſpeakes) that they be admitted to him.</p>
            <p>An abſolute command, and a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one, and ſhewed to be ſo; he gives a Reaſon of it, as a righteous Lord, who does not though his leaſt <hi>word</hi> might bind us to ſtrict obedience) inforce any thing by his abſolute and meer anthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but deals reaſonably and juſtly with us; he gives an account, of whom no man wiſely durſt ask, <hi>What doeſt thou? why doeſt thou this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, there is not only a <hi>command</hi> in the Text, <hi>Suffer them to come;</hi> but a <hi>reaſon</hi> of it alſo, <hi>for, of ſuch is, &amp;c.</hi> Two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts.</p>
            <p>And the command it ſelfe is not <hi>lightly</hi> given, leſt ſo they ſhould ſlight it;
<note place="margin">Sub-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> but to ſhew the importance of it, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the duty, he charges it upon
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170480:44"/>them a ſecond time; he commands <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively,</hi> and he commands <hi>negatively;</hi> there is <hi>Sinite,</hi> and there is, <hi>Ne prohibite: Suffer them,</hi> that is once; and again I ſay unto you, <hi>Forbid them not:</hi> So there be two points in the firſt part.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Reaſon</hi> too there is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that ſcarce any Expoſitor miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whom I have read upon the place, that in the Original it is not, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; not <hi>illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, theirs</hi> is the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but <hi>talium, of ſuch is, &amp;c.</hi> So in all the three Evangeliſts; and that, ſaies <hi>Muſculus,</hi> (and indeed, who not?) is much more than if he had ſaid <hi>theirs;</hi> to give notice, that, not only <hi>thoſe</hi> little ones did belong to Heaven, but alſo, that they did <hi>ſo</hi> belong to it, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever were not <hi>like</hi> them, were not ſuch a one as they, he muſt have no entrance there.</p>
            <p>And this obſervation will require alſo a two-fold diſcourſe in the ſecond part; one for <hi>Illorum,</hi> and another for <hi>Talium:</hi> the firſt for <hi>theſe</hi> children, their right to this Kingdome, for they are included; the ſecond for thoſe that are <hi>like</hi> them, and that whoſoever is not <hi>ſuch</hi> is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:170480:44"/>
            <p>We begin with the <hi>Command,</hi> and firſt with the <hi>affirmative</hi> part of it; <hi>Sinite parvulos, Suffer little children to come unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt therefore came to us,
<note place="margin">Sinite.</note> that he might make us able to come to him: And as his comming to us was <hi>generall;</hi> not to ſome <hi>one man;</hi> not to ſome <hi>one Family;</hi> not to ſome <hi>one People,</hi> but <hi>in Mundum,</hi> into the whole <hi>World; Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. As he came to <hi>all,</hi> ſo he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites <hi>all</hi> to come to him; <hi>Venite omnes, Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all:</hi> If the <hi>Jew</hi> may come, the <hi>Greek</hi> may come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; if the <hi>free</hi> may come, the <hi>bond</hi> may come alſo; if the <hi>Male</hi> may come, the <hi>Female</hi> may come alſo; and, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks there, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. concerning <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>Sexes,</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of life, that there is no difference, they are all alike, in this reſpect; <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither Male nor Female, ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> So may we go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the ſame ground, to all eſtates, all fortunes, all ages; there is neither noble nor ignoble, there is neither rich nor poor, there is neither old nor yong,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170480:45"/>there is neither man nor child; but as both of them are <hi>Homo,</hi> ſo all of them are <hi>unum, Omnes unum, ye are all one in Christ Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet, leſt Generalities ſhould not take enough deep impreſſion in mens mindes; and that theſe little children, who are not able to plead their owne cauſe, nor to urge the ſtrength of this Grant, which they have as largely from God, as any others, leſt they ſhould lie neglected, as not contained in the Roll of them that are invited, as if Chriſt had not room and entertainment for their children, as well as themſelvs, when they come to his Houſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the ſight of theſe Children, he does from them, as from thender flowers, gather the ſweet comfort of this more particular Doctrine, to feed his Diſciples with; add after this general invitation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. he claps down this as a Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, that they be not left out, <hi>Sinite parvulos,</hi> bring <hi>them</hi> with you too; he that provides for <hi>Pulli Corvorum, Job</hi> 38.41. the <hi>young</hi> ones of the <hi>Ravens,</hi> and is ſtill a <hi>Helper of the friendleſſe,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſtiles him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.16. he will alſo be a <hi>Father</hi> even of the <hi>fatherleſs, Pſ.</hi> 68.5.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170480:45"/>and take ſpeciall order for the <hi>Childrens</hi> comming; a command in particular for <hi>them: Suffer little children to come unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis worth the while to conſider, how fully Chriſt does expreſſe his love to <hi>children</hi> upon any occaſion: once, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this time, we read in the Goſpel, that he had to do with a <hi>childe,</hi> that childe whom he propounded to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples imitation, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. and both him at that time, and theſe at this time, <hi>he took up in his arms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 36.</note> that we may believe they were dear to him.</p>
            <p>And indeed, very eaſily may we be induced to believe it, when we conſider the <hi>nature</hi> of God, and the <hi>condition</hi> of Children; God is a God of pity and compaſſion, as he ſtiles himſelfe; nay, as he proclaims himſelfe (ſo well he is pleaſed with it) <hi>Deus, Deus miſericors, &amp; clemens: The Lord, The Lord God, mercifull and gracious, Exod.</hi> 34.6. And no ſo fit an object of pity; nothing ſo like to move compaſſion, as the very fight of tender children: <hi>Jacob</hi> knew this well enough when he was to meet his enraged Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eſau,</hi> of whom he was <hi>greatly afraid,</hi> ſaies the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.7. (for indeed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170480:46"/>the rage of a Brother is rage indeed, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> has noted, <hi>Quae apud concordes vincula charitatis, incitamenta irarum, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud infenſos ſunt. Annal.</hi>1. That which binds men together in love, whilſt they are at concord, puts them farther at variance, being once enemies) when he was to meet the wrath of this Brother, ſo incenſed againſt him; and therefore bethought himſelfe of the beſt means to appeaſe him, ſending Preſent after Preſent (great and rich ones) to win upon his favour, before he durſt come near him: All this notwithſtanding, when he drew near him, when <hi>Jacob lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up his eyes, and looked, and beheld Eſau come,</hi> and his Army with him, <hi>four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men,</hi> he miſtruſted the ſtrength of all his preſents; he doubts he is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled enough, he is driven to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſhift for the effecting it, to that which ſurely will (if any thing can) make his fury fall, and his heart even melt within him; he takes the <hi>children,</hi> and divides them to their ſeverall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; he puts the handmaids and their <hi>children</hi> formoſt, and <hi>Leah</hi> and her <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> after, and <hi>Rachel</hi> and her <hi>Joſeph</hi> after; this, this prevailed againſt all his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170480:46"/>Brothers prae-conceived malice; <hi>Eſau ran to meet him, and embraced him,</hi> ſaies the Text, <hi>and fell on his neck and kiſſed him, and they wept, Gen.</hi> 33.4.</p>
            <p>May we not thinke, <hi>Jacob</hi> learnt this way from the ſtory of his Uncle <hi>Iſhmael?</hi> who, when he was a <hi>childe,</hi> being in diſtreſſe, with his Mother <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, ſo near death, that the Mother left him, as not able to endure to ſee the death of the childe, but went a good way off, and wept, and cried, lift up her voice and wept; yet, that place tels us not, that God heard her loud cry, but that he was moved to compaſſion with the voice of the <hi>childe,</hi> which yet was ſo ſoft a cry, that we hear nothing of it in the ſtory; <hi>Hagar cried aloud, but God heard the voice of the Lad, and for his ſake ſent her comfort, Geneſ.</hi> 21.17.</p>
            <p>We cannot eaſily conceive it; the compaſſionate love which God bears to little children, he loves the very name of them, and gives it to them he loves moſt; and that then, when he moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to make them know he loves them; what name did Chriſt call his beloved Diſciples by, when he was, now, ſhortly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170480:47"/>to leave them, and was newly entered the liſts of his conflict with death, when <hi>Judas</hi> had taken the Sop, and Satan was entered into him, and had ſet him on working (not the works of God, but of his Father the Divel) that he went out immediately, when the plot was now laying, that muſt anon take effect upon his life?

            <p>So great care argues as great love; and ſo great love loves to enjoy the thing that's loved, that as wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> brings in this <hi>wiſdome of the Father,</hi> the Son of God, ſpeaking of himſelf, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.31. <hi>Deliciae meae, eſſe cum filiis hominum, My delight is to be with the ſons of men,</hi> ſo will it not offend him to be ſpoken in his name, <hi>Deliciae meae, eſſe cum Filiolis homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, My delight is to be with the Children of men:</hi> and therefore, if not for <hi>their</hi> ſakes, yet for <hi>his</hi> ſake, <hi>Sinite Parvulos, Suffer little Children to come unto him.</hi>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170480:49"/>which ſeems ſo needleſſe a beheſt, and we need not look far for it; the laſt words before the Text tell us, that <hi>the Diſciples rebuked them:</hi> why they ſhould do ſo would be enquired, and it will be no hard matter to gueſſe at it; for, the beſt do no more than as probability of Reaſon leads them, ſeeing it is not expreſt in the Text; of one thing they are all agreed (they will not, and we muſt not be too harſh in our cenſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Diſciples) what was not the cauſe; not envy in them, or ill will toward the children, or their friends that brought them: And for what was the cauſe, in the general, there is no great difference; a wrong-grounded zeal that they bare towards their Maſter (ſuch a one as S. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcovered to be in <hi>Iſrael, Rom.</hi> 10.2. that they had a <hi>zeal,</hi> but not <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to knowledge</hi>) S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaies, 'twas zeal of his Honour, for they ran regardleſly to him, and almoſt upon him; and ſo <hi>Theophylact</hi> conjectures, that the women came in diſordered heaps, thronging about him with their children for a bleſſing, and this they thought ſome diſparagement to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and authority of his Doctrine, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170480:49"/>he ſhould have any thing to do with Children; S. <hi>Jerome</hi> is of opinion, that they had regard to his eaſe in ſo doing, that he ſhould not be preſs'd too much, and wearied with the throng, and he there-hence argues the imperfection of their faith; and with him agrees S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> in his Comment upon S. <hi>Luke,</hi> that it was their obſervance toward their Maſter, to avoid the trouble of the croud. Again, whereas the common cauſes of mens comming to him, were either to receive the benefit of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his Doctrine, or the eaſe from ſome infirmity, by the power of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; theſe were <hi>not ſick,</hi> might the Diſciples think, and ſo, not in need of the one; they were <hi>Children,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not capable of the other.</p>
            <p>But theſe were the thoughts of men, who judged of Chriſt, by their carnall ſence, and according to his outward appearance; and yet not unlikely to be the Diſciples errors; eſpecially the firſt of them, which men are prone to run upon; they are needleſly afraid to think too meanly of Chriſt, and that has been the cauſe of too many ſuperſtitions in the Church; this one amongſt the reſt,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170480:50"/>that men become Suitors to the Saints in Heaven, to mediate their Prayers to God, becauſe they think it diſhonorable to Chriſt, to be the common Advocate; as alſo, to fear to think too honorably of him, and to deal too bountifully with him, in his Houſe and Houſhold, has been the cauſe of prophanations more than enow; <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>But whither ſo faſt with theſe Sons and theſe Daughters that are carried? why, to Chriſt no queſtion; thither the Text calls them: True, but the way to him? No other left us by his direction, for our firſt entrance, but <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> to that our Church Liturgy applies this Text: nor is there any of our Ancient Writers, but does ſo; yea, in a manner appropriate it thereto; and whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they treat of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> ever this verſe comes in; that has made ſome of them call Baptiſm, <hi>Introitum ad Regnum Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi> Heavens entry: Some, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Initiation; Some, the Door;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170480:51"/>Some, the Gate of Heaven.</p>
            <p>For, whereas no man can come to Chriſt, except he be a <hi>New man,</hi> and we are all born with the corruption of the <hi>Old man</hi> upon us, <hi>Quod natum ex carne, caro,</hi> John 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh: Conceived in ſin, and born in iniquity, Pſal.</hi> 51.5. and therefore, <hi>Natura, filii irae,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, <hi>Sons of wrath by nature, Eph.</hi> 2.3.

               </gap>, as the Enthuſiaſts will have it, immediately; but by ſuch ordinary meanes as he has appointed, both for himſelfe to offer, and for us to apprehend, eternal Salvation: The means allotted to us in this behalfe, who
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170480:51"/>are Receivers, is <hi>Faith,</hi> the onely Hand he has given us, to reach out, and lay hold on, and apply unto ourſelves the Grace of God offered, the merit of Chriſt, with the conſequents thereof, <hi>Forgiveneſſe of our ſins, juſtification and eternal ſalvation: By faith of Jeſus Chriſt the righteouſneſſe of God is unto all, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that believe,</hi> Rom. 3.22.</p>
            <p>But then in reſpect of God, who is the Donor, the means by which he does u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually beſtow theſe Graces upon us, and convey them unto us, are two; his <hi>Word,</hi> his <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the efficacy of his <hi>Word</hi> no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doubteth; <hi>By hearing comes faith, Rom.</hi> 10.17. and <hi>by the hearing of faith is the ſpirit received, Gal.</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p>And, for the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> they have as little reaſon to trouble themſelves, and the <hi>Church of God</hi> with ſeruples of doubt, as if they were but bare <hi>ſignes</hi> and no more: Do not the Fathers call the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, <hi>Verbum viſibile, a viſihle Word?</hi> Are they not, as it were, an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> Receive they not all their worth and vertue, and operation, not only from the preſent Grace, but from the ancient Appointment and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170480:52"/>of God, and <hi>from the Word of God,</hi> which, by <hi>Divine,</hi> as well as <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Ordination, is joyned to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Elements?</p>
            <p>But, to make it good againſt them, in this <hi>one</hi> Sacrament, which we have now in hand. If he, and he onely, ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> in an <hi>ordinary</hi> courſe, who <hi>believes</hi> and is <hi>baptized, Mark</hi> 16.16. may we not well reckon Baptiſm an <hi>ordinary means</hi> of this <hi>ſalvation?</hi> If of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> then alſo of thoſe other <hi>graces</hi> which are the <hi>way</hi> unto it, <hi>regeneration, remiſſion of ſins, righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>renewing of the mind; Except a man be born of water and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, John</hi> 3.5. there's <hi>regeneration</hi> by it: <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> preach'd the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the <hi>remiſſion of ſins, Luk.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Repent,</hi> ſaies S. <hi>Peter, and be baptized for the remiſſion of ſins, Act.</hi> 2.28. and, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> ſays <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> upon his converſion, <hi>and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, Act.</hi> 22.16. there's remiſſion: <hi>Ye are waſh'd,</hi> ſaies St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. then preſently follows upon that, <hi>Ye are ſanctified, ye are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, v.</hi> 11. there be two other <hi>graces: As many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.27. and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170480:52"/>having <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon us, we have his <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> his <hi>merits,</hi> his <hi>righteouſneſſe; how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things? Rom.</hi> 8.32.</p>
            <p>So that, as S. <hi>James,</hi> in the caſe of our <hi>regeneration,</hi> does joyn together <hi>the Spirit</hi> and <hi>the Word,</hi> which is one of the means he uſes to that purpoſe; <hi>Of his own will begat he us, with the Word of Truth, Jam.</hi> 1.18. ſo our Saviour Chriſt does joyn the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which is another effectuall meanes; <hi>Except a man be born of water and the ſpirit, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of God, Joh.</hi> 3.5. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> couples both theſe means together, makes them march hand in hand, as equally uſefull to <hi>ſanctification</hi> in the Church of God; <hi>Chriſt loved the Church and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie it and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the Word, Eph.</hi> 5.26. what ſhall I ſay more? This will I ſay, that,</p>
            <p>A <hi>cauſe,</hi> therefore we need not fear to call it, of our <hi>regeneration</hi> and ſalvation, though not the <hi>principall;</hi> that's God himſelfe; yet, the <hi>inſtrumentall,</hi> as we ſpeak in Schools, or <hi>medium; He ſaved us,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle; <hi>God, Tit.</hi> 3. there's the <hi>principall</hi> cauſe, <hi>by the waſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi>

            <p>The neceſſity therefore that Iſpake of, for the comming to Chriſt this way, for our being renewed by this ſecond Birth, I hope appeareth: which neceſſity not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we do not preach unto you to be ſo <hi>abſolute,</hi> as if God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another door into Heaven; as if he had ſo tied his ſaving Grace to this means, as without it 'twere impoſſible to be attained by any: this is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the common door, by which he hath appointed us to enter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on <hi>our</hi> part, we are bound to this way, if we can get to it; but if there be an impoſſibility on our part, and that without our contempt, or neglect of his Ordinance, it ſhall pleaſe God we be prevented (I ſpeak not of them that are born <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>Church, Qui foris ſunt, Deus judicat,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. we leave them (with S. <hi>Paul</hi>) to be <hi>judged by God,</hi> but) for them who are born <hi>in fidere,</hi> in that league which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi>

            <p>Could any man have thought, that ſo long as this Canon had been in force, it ſhould not have been preſervative ſtrong enough againſt that poiſon, which the Divel hath ſince inſtill'd into ſome mens brains, who have enacted a Statute in their Conventicle, as it were in ſpight of this, that till they come to years of diſcretion, to the uſe of reaſon, they come not to Baptiſm, that is to ſay (ſay Chriſt what he will) <hi>till they ceaſe to be children, they ſhall in no wiſe come to Chriſt:</hi> They ſlept ſurely while the enemy ſow'd theſe Tares in their hearts!

            <p>And indeed it muſt needs be ſo, when we conſider, that not onely ſuch are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but that whoſoever is <hi>not ſuch,</hi> is excluded; ſo S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> too in ſetting down this Story, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little childe, he ſhall not enter therein:</hi> Are we driven then here to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his queſtion?
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.4.</note> 
               <hi>How can a man be a child when he is old?

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170480:59"/>as many of us as would finde the way to Heaven; ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it for the former, <hi>Be children in malice,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> be harmleſſe, be innocent; and our Saviour Chriſt expounds it for the later, <hi>Whoſo ſhall humble himſelfe as this little childe, the ſame is greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, Matt.</hi> 18.4.</p>
            <p>So that every childiſh quality is not to be imitated by us; S. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids that in that place to the <hi>Corinthians, Be not childiſh in underſtanding,</hi> and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he too) chides thoſe men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. who were ſo childiſhly ignorant, that they had yet need of <hi>milke,</hi> and not of <hi>ſtrong meat: Solomon</hi> is weary of induring them, <hi>Quouſque parvuli diligitis Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam?</hi> Prov. 1.22. <hi>How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity?</hi> But they are propounded to our imitation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thoſe good qualities, in which God is ſpecially delighted; thoſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, are chiefly, the two I nam'd unto you, <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> of each of which very briefly, and we have done.</p>
            <p>This Innocency we muſt not ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, as I finde ſome of the Papiſts,

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170480:60"/>who thinke that children, upon their Baptiſm, are ſo clear from ſin, that, now, they have not the leaſt ſpot or ſtain left in them, and would have us be ſo: They are indeed in that Well-ſpring of New Birth, ſo throughly waſh'd from the guilt of Original ſin which they brought with them into the world, that it is not laid to their charge to <hi>condemn</hi> them; No, <hi>no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 8.1. But yet the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of that concupiſcence, which does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave our whole nature, are not ſo done away, but that we have ſtill need to <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the Old man</hi> within us all the dayes of our life; <hi>Mendaces ſumus,</hi> ſaies S. <hi>John,</hi> 'tis a bold <hi>lie,</hi> to ſay we have <hi>no ſin</hi> in us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8.

            <p>And therefore,
<note place="margin">Humilitas</note> if we mark it, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Chriſt, where he expounds himſelf, <hi>c.</hi> 18. inſiſts more upon that other child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like quality, and commends it unto us for the beſt way to Chriſt, and to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Humility;</hi> Not whoſoever ſhall be <hi>without ſin,</hi> as this little childe, but, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall humble himſelfe as this little Childe,

Who ever ſaw ſpark of pride in Swathing-clouts? or the leaſt ſhew of diſdain for any uſage, though he were laid in a <hi>Crib,</hi> in a <hi>Manger,</hi> as the <hi>best Childe</hi> was? <hi>The Heir of the Houſe, as long as he is a Childe,</hi> (S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us) <hi>differs nothing from a Servant, though he be Lord of all, Gal.</hi> 4.1. The <hi>Heir of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> took upon him the <hi>form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Phil.</hi> 2.7.

            <p>We ſee the Pattern; conſider what need there is that we imitate it; that as our children are ſo, ſo Gods Children muſt be ſo: We muſt know therefore, that the way to Heaven is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the way of this world; that as <hi>Seneca</hi> bids his <hi>Wiſe man</hi> go againſt the Croud, march the contrary way to the multitude; ſo in things appertaining to ſalvation, we muſt <hi>omnino diverſa via in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere,</hi> ſayes one, For they proceed in ſuch a courſe, as in the eyes of worldly men ſeems moſt unlikely; here, <hi>If any ſeems to be wiſe, let him become a fool, that he may be wiſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Here, <hi>He that findeth his life ſhall loſe it, and he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his life for my ſake ſhall finde it, Matth.</hi> 10.39. Here, <hi>Whoſoever will be great, let him be your Minister, and whoſoever will be chief, let him be your ſervant, Matth.</hi> 20.26. Here, he that became <hi>obedient to death,

            <p>OUR Saviour Chriſt, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he humbled himſelfe to death, the ſhamefull death, would, by this extraordinary act of Power, proclaim to the World, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170480:67"/>he did indeed humble himſelfe; none elſe could do it; that <hi>Pilate</hi> was deceiv'd in his imaginary <hi>Power</hi> he thought <hi>he had to crucifie him, or to releaſe him, John</hi> 19.10. that he was the <hi>good Shepheard, who gave his life for his Sheep, John</hi> 10.11. <hi>No man could take it from him, but he laid it down of himſelfe, v.</hi> 18. Therefore he would ride in triumph into <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> and in the <hi>Temple, his Fathers Houſe,</hi> he would do an act (of Juſtice, true; but withall) of Majeſty and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; one, the greateſt that ever he vouchſafed to ſhew while he liv'd among us: Such opinion S. <hi>Jerome</hi> had of it, though the <hi>giving ſight to one born blinde</hi> were a great Miracle;
<note place="margin">Jo. 9.6, 7.</note> and <hi>the reſtoring life to a Carkaſs putrified in the grave,</hi>

            <p>And beſides his power manifeſted in his Miracle, the ſtory gives us a taſte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of that care which he had of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers glory, and the juſt indignation which he had conceived againſt them that had diſhonoured his Houſe; ſoon as he was entered the City in State, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goes he? not to <hi>Davids</hi> Tower, not to the Kings Palace; no, <hi>he ſought not his own glory,</hi> he had told them plainly before, <hi>John</hi> 8.50. nay, he ſhunn'd it,

               <hi>when they would have taken him by force, to make him a King, John</hi> 6.15. <hi>His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was not of this world:

<note place="margin">Luk. 2.48</note> wiſt ye not, (ſo he ſatisfies his Mothers griefe for his abſence) <hi>Wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my Fathers buſineſs? Luke</hi> 2.49. This in particular above all other buſineſſes, he took ſpeciall care of; when he began his Preaching, he began this Reformation; againſt the firſt Paſſeover that we read he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at,

               <note place="margin">Matt. 5.9.</note> (<hi>bleſſed</hi> Title for ever) the means of reconcilement betwixt God and the World; and yet when it comes to the point of Honour for his Fathers Houſe, then this Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Peaceable, this mediating and reconciling Man, firſt falls upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the very Peace-Maker, and after, upon his Fathers Enemies; then <hi>Zelus Domus tuae comedit me, Pſal.</hi> 69.9. <hi>The

<note place="margin">Domus Mea.</note> this Houſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to God, and his claim put in for his ſpeciall title to it: Three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon titles there are that God has to all things in the world, by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come properly all his, his by all right: 1. the unqueſtionable right of Creation; Man, that <hi>cannot make</hi> a hair, not <hi>one hair white, or black, Matth.</hi> 5.36. and if not ſo ſmall a thing, not ſo much as one, nothing; God is the Maker of all. 2. of Poſſeſſion, he holds them all: Man is but Tenant at will of the very breath he draws; it is God, ſaies <hi>David,</hi> who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170480:71"/>when he will, <hi>taketh away his breath, Pſal.</hi> 104.29. God is Proprietary of him, and of all he has. 3. of Preſervation; he ſaves them all, <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>giveth, taketh away</hi> too, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. that chapter proves it by <hi>Induction,</hi> by enumeration of almoſt every thing, <hi>Servants, Oxen, and Aſſes,</hi> 15. <hi>Sheep,</hi> 16. <hi>Camels,</hi> 17. Houſe too, and children alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and thoſe of both ſorts, <hi>ſons and daughters,</hi> as it is expreſly ſet downe, <hi>v.</hi> 13. Man cannot preſerve himſelf, and his cattel much leſſe; 'tis <hi>thou O God,</hi> that <hi>preſerveſt Man and Beast, Pſal.</hi> 36.6. 'Tis thou, O God, that ſaiſt, <hi>the Cattel upon a thouſand hills are mine,</hi> at my keeping, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.10. And thus to be his, is all no more than the very refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to nature in the things, and to the God of nature, as the Faſhioner, the Owner, and Conſerver of them.</p>
            <p>But yet, in particular, beſides Nature, ſome other reſpect there is in God, as it were in a civil and moral kind, whereby things become yet further his; His by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> when he ſpecially employes them, and makes them his Inſtruments, above the ordinary courſe of nature; and then are they his by claim and challenge too, he calls them ſo, and himſelfe ſets his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170480:71"/>own name upon them; and that's here in this <hi>Domus mea,</hi> the ſubject of my Text, Gods own demand of it in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to himſelfe as his own, and for his more peculiar ſervice, <hi>Domus mea,</hi> it's <hi>my Houſe.</hi>

We give unto each his place, and acknowledge, that in theſe two Ghoſtly exerciſes, we have verified unto us that continual intercourſe of Angels, betwixt the throne of God in Heaven, and his Church here militant on earth; that the aſſembling of Gods people to hear, is the receiving of Angels deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from above; that their meeting to pray, is the ſending of Angels upwards; his heavenly inſpirations, and our holy deſires are as ſo many Angels, aſcending and deſcending in intercourſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce betwixt God and man: Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brings us to know, that God is our

            <p>And when can this Chapter begin more ſeaſonably, then upon a <hi>cor contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> and <hi>tribulatum,</hi> upon a troubled heart? when his Diſciples hearts are ſo confounded with grief and fear, in the laſt Chapter, 'tis high time to begin this, and to begin it with this cordial <hi>Non turbetur cor veſtrum,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 1.</note> let not your heart be troubled,</hi> the ingredients to this cordial are two, Faith and Hope; Faith in the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170480:92"/>firſt verſe, <hi>ye believe in God, believe alſo in me;</hi> there muſt be a faith to lay hold on God in general, and a faith to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Chriſt alſo as God, to believe him to be <hi>God of the ſubſtance of his Father,</hi> infinite Almighty, and ſo able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this death; that though he goes from them, yet he goes not one ſtep on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his death, but another ſtep to his reſurrection, and a third ſtep to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion; and then comes in hope <hi>v.</hi> 2. a fit ingredient too for hearts-eaſe, but for which (we ſay in our Proverb) the heart would break, hope, whoſe object is ſome future good to our ſelves, though hard, yet poſſible, ſo the Schoole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it, poſſible, though not by our ſelves, yet by the help of this Chriſt, whom we believe in as God; the future good is the many <hi>manſions in his Fathers houſe,</hi> and the poſſibility of our attaining them by his help is in my Text, <hi>Vado parare, I go to prepare a place for you.</hi>

            <p>So then, as to his former ſpeeches, it ſuited well, <hi>becauſe I have ſaid theſe things unto you, ſorrow hath fill'd your heart;</hi> ſo to this, and that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, it will as well agree, which our Saviour has in the beginning of the 16.

<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> The <hi>Tristitia imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit cor vestrum,</hi> the ſorrow which the Diſciples of Chriſt conceiv'd in their hearts, upon notice of his departure from them, in the firſt word, <hi>Vado, I go:</hi> And ſecondly, the <hi>Non conturbetur cor vestrum,</hi> the removing that ſorrow from their hearts, by informing them of

               <hi>I go:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vado.</note> Here it would be conſidered, how Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>go.</hi> And, for the better underſtanding it, it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to anſwer <hi>Simon Peters</hi> queſtion, to calm his expoſtulation; <hi>Lord, whither?</hi> Lord, why? to what end <hi>doſt thou go?</hi> And for that we have ſome light in this verſe where my Text lies; <hi>I go to prepare a place;</hi> and that place is among thoſe many Manfions in his Fathers Houſe, <hi>In my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions:</hi> And that thither he goes, it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by his owne cleare anſwer to the queſtion, <hi>John</hi> 16.5. <hi>I go my way to him that ſent me:</hi> or, if we be ignorant who that is, he gives it us in plainer termes yet, <hi>John</hi> 14.12. <hi>Vado ad Patrem, I go to my Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:170480:94"/>
            <p>Now this brings in the difficulty that would be cleared,
<note place="margin">Quomodo.</note> how Chriſt can be ſaid to go to his Father, God to God; I will not take up time with that common objection, that God is every where, and fills all places, <hi>Heaven and Earth full of his glory;</hi> the anſwer is obvious; but for this particular, how Chriſt ſhould go to the Father, who has told us before, that <hi>the Father is in him, and he in the Father, John</hi> 10.38. and that <hi>the Father, who dwelleth in him, he doth the works, John</hi> 14.10. how can he be ſaid to go to him? ſhal we think that thought of blaſphemy, that the Father was now gone from him? had forſaken him? No, <hi>Non derelinques,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 16.10.</note> thou ſhalt not leave my ſoul</hi> when it is <hi>in Hell,</hi> not his Godhead only, which he had from the Father, but alſo his ſoul, and that humane nature which he took from the Virgin, <hi>Ego &amp; Pater unum, John</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> The Father is with that, in that alſo; and yet for all this, <hi>relinquo mundum, &amp; vado ad Patrem,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>I leave the World, and go unto the Father:
<note place="margin">Jo. 16.28.</note> I leaven the World, and go;</hi> See, if this phraſe will help any thing for our ſatisfaction in this doubt! we indeed do then go to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170480:95"/>God, when we leave the World; that is,
<note place="margin">Col. 3.2.</note> when we ceaſe to <hi>ſet our affections on things which are below,</hi> when we <hi>give over to love the World,
<note place="margin">1 Jo. 2.15</note> and the things that are in the World;</hi> when by ſtrength of faith we unintangle our ſelves from the Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, the baits and allurements of it; when,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.20.</note> as ſpeaks S. <hi>Peter,</hi> we get to <hi>eſcape the pollutions of the world;</hi> when having our mindes enlightned by Faith, and our hearts encouraged with Hope, and our breſts inflamed with divine Love, we begin to know God, to contemplate his Goodneſſe, to <hi>delight in his Teſtimonies,</hi> to <hi>trust in the Lord God,</hi> then we go to him, and we cleave faſt to him, <hi>andhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere bonum</hi> we crie with <hi>David, It is good for me to hold me faſt by God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 73.28.</note> Thus we leave the World, and go to the Father: But Chriſt does not ſo, for he was never intangled, never polluted; he was that holy, Innocent, unpolluted; he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſet his affections on things below, that, by a change of them, he ſhould go to the Father.</p>
            <p>But yet we too, go one ſtep nearer than this; by this we but begin to go to God, we do not perfectly arrive at our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end; we but come to the threſhold,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170480:95"/>the outward Court, Gods Houſe; we then enter into his <hi>Privy Chamber,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lu. 22.30</note> to <hi>eat and drink in his Kingdome,</hi> when after this life, inſtead of our faith, we ſhall obtain the light of God; inſtead of our Hope, we ſhall come into poſſeſſion; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of our weak imperfect charity here, we ſhall be moſt ſafe in that degree of <hi>perfect love which casteth out all fear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Jo. 4.18</note> when in the light of his glory we ſhall heare himſelfe ſpeaking to our ſouls, <hi>Euge, bone ſerve, Well done,
<note place="margin">Matt. 25.21.</note> good and faithfull ſervant, enter into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But neither does this aſſoil the doubt; nor can Chriſts going to the Father hold any proportion with this ſecond ſtep of ours; he, in the very beginning of his Conception in the womb, was thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; that bleſſed Soule of his, at the very inſtant of being created by God, and joyn'd unto the Word, had in it the fulneſſe of all Wiſdome, Grace, Glory, eternal beatitude, and therefore could not, in this reſpect, to ſpeak properly, pronounce his <hi>Vado ad Patrem, I go unto the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proceed we then, yet, one ſtep further in Mans journey, and ſee, if by that we can finde out the way that Chriſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170480:96"/>went; for, all this while we have drawn but one part of Man, his Soul, out of the world, and reduc'd it to its native home: But at the laſt day, when <hi>this Mortal</hi> body of ours <hi>ſhall put on immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15 53.</note> this corruptible</hi> fleſh <hi>ſhall put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption;</hi> when it ſhall alſo be freed from thoſe neceſſities, with which it is incumbred in this world, when it ſhall have no need to be refreſh'd with meat and drink and ſleep, to be warm'd with cloathes and fire, or cool'd with gentle blaſts, or defended with houſe and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, then ſhall we go quite out of the world, finiſh the utmoſt of our journey, and the whole man come to the end of it, to his God in Heaven.</p>
            <p>This, beloved, is the third and laſt ſtep, which Chriſt himſelfe had not yet gone, and muſt go; his Body was not yet in Heaven: This was it he meant, when he ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>I came forth</hi> from the Father, <hi>and am come into the World; Again, I leave the World, and go unto my Father, John</hi> 16.28. What means he by the firſt, <hi>I came from my Father into the World?</hi> why I tooke upon me this humane body, ſubject to hunger and thirſt, and cold and heat, and troubles
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170480:96"/>and ſorrows, and ſmart and death, ſuch as the reſt of mens bodies in this world, which are abaſed under the yoak and burden of mortality and corruption; what means he by the laſt, <hi>I leave the world, and go to my Father?</hi> Not that he leaves this humane body which he had once taken, and remaines onely that which before he was, God with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but, I caſt off all enſigns, all bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and tokens of mortality and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility; I will ſtill weare this humane body, but now by me made a glorified body, which ſhall ſtill live; but free from the bondage of worldly griefes, of worldly neceſſities; in reſt, in tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in joy, in glory: Theſe are the words (ſaies Chriſt to his Diſciples after his reſurrection, when his Body was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified) <hi>Theſe are the words which I ſpake unto you while I was yet with you, Luke</hi> 24.46. What thinke we of this, <hi>while I was with you?</hi> Was not Chriſt now with them when he ſpake thus unto them? while I was with you, while I was as you are in the world, ſubject to thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which the world impoſeth, and in need of thoſe ſupplies which the world affordeth; now I am not with you, I
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170480:97"/>am with the Father, I live now even in reſpect of my body, that ſame life which the father lives; free from all trouble, from all change: and thus may Chriſt truly be ſaid to go unto the Father.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould this then breed ſo much grief to his Diſciples? why ſhould their hearts be ſo fill'd with ſorrow for this? what ſhould need our Saviours <hi>non turbetur cor vestrum?</hi> any counſel, or comfort, where there is ſeeming ſo little cauſe of diſcontent: one would think they ſhould rejoyce rather; and ſo Chriſt tells them plainly, <hi>If ye lov'd me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid I goe unto the Father, v.</hi> 28. but poor ſouls, they were ſo wounded with the <hi>vado,</hi> 't ſhould ſeem they minded not the reſt, ſo heart-ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with the ſad news of his going from them, that they ne're thought of, to whom; their love was ſuch to him, that they would not go from him to any, <hi>Domine ad quem ibimus?</hi> when Jeſus asked them, <hi>will ye alſo go away Jo.</hi> 6.68. <hi>Lord to whom ſhall we go?</hi> and their weakneſſe did haply expect a reciprocal affection in Chriſt ſuitable to their ignorant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, Lord to whom ſhal we go from thee?

The word <hi>Manſion</hi> here intimates the durance, the perpetuity of it, a <hi>manendo,</hi> no fear, no danger of the loſſe of it, of trouble in it; ſuch a <hi>glorious Kingdom,</hi> ſaies <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>beautifull crowne</hi> is there to be <hi>received at the Lords hands, Wiſd.</hi> 5.16. And if this will not, I know not what outward expreſſion can make us pray heartily every day, <hi>Adveniat Regnum tuum, adveniat nobis; Let thy Kingdome come</hi> to us, that holy paſſionate deſire which <hi>David</hi> had to <hi>enter into theſe courts of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 84.2. This place which Chriſt is gone to prepare for us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preparation</hi> of the place is another branch of this ſecond Generall part,
<note place="margin">Vado pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare.</note> 
               <hi>Vado parare;</hi> he goes upon an Errand, for all his Diſciples, to prepare this place for them.</p>
            <p>But if this be all the occaſion to draw Chriſt from them, one would think he ſhould not need to make ſuch haſte for them; for, if we remember, this place needs not now preparing; 'twas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170480:105"/>long ſince; What ſaies Chriſt to the Gueſts of it? <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed, inherit the Kingdom, Paratum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis à conſtitutione mundi, prepared for you;</hi> when? even <hi>from the beginning of the world:</hi> Surely Man was borne to no leſſe than a Kingdome from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: In the very begining ſee it; <hi>Let us make Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> ſaies God, <hi>in our Image, after our likeneſſe:</hi> what then? why pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in the next words, <hi>Let them have dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowle of the Air, and over all the Cattell, and over all the Earth:</hi> A Dominion, a Kingdome, at the firſt, in the beginning; and a large one too, but not permanent; he held it but a while; <hi>Man being in honour, had no underſtanding, Pſal.</hi> 49.12. to hold what God had given him, to <hi>abide</hi> by it; he was ſoon diſpoſſeſt by his early ſin, ſoon vanquiſh'd out of this Dominion: And therefore well was it with him, that God had prepared another, a better for him; this place, this Kingdome, <hi>Paratum à Conſtitutione mundi,</hi> from which he could not fall.</p>
            <pb n="201" facs="tcp:170480:105"/>
            <p>But how will this hold? <hi>Paratum,</hi> and <hi>Vado parare?</hi> why, as S. <hi>Austin (Tract.</hi> 68. <hi>in Jo.</hi>) quotes that ſaying from the Prophet, <hi>Deus fecit quae fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura ſunt:</hi> 'Tis no unuſual phraſe in holy Scripture, when they ſpeake of Gods actions which are infinite, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall as himſelfe, to whom all things are continually preſent, which are, and which were, and which are to come, <hi>Creavi, &amp; faciam illud, Iſa.</hi> 46.11. So <hi>Tremelius</hi> tranſlates it, as well as the <hi>Vulgat edition, I have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and I will make it;</hi> juſt as in theſe two Texts, I have prepared a place for you, and I will prepare it: There is the like expreſſion in the end of the two and twentieth <hi>Pſalm, The Heaven ſhall declare his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto a People that ſhall be borne, whom the Lord hath made:</hi> He hath already made them, and yet they ſhall be borne, in their ſucceſſion, to the end of the World; as <hi>David</hi> does acknowledge of himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. that, before he was borne, <hi>All his members were written in Gods Book, when as yet there was none of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="202" facs="tcp:170480:106"/>
            <p>So this place was prepared, as Chriſt is ſaid to be ſlain, <hi>ab origine mundi, from the foundation of the World;</hi> and yet he was ſlain after that, by the promiſe of God, <hi>The Serpent ſhall bruiſe his heele, Gen.</hi> 3.15. He was ſlain in the faith of the Father, before his incarnation; he was ſlain in the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Law, which were this Lamb ſacramentally; he was ſlain in his ſeverall members, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? Act.</hi> 9.4. He was ſlain in <hi>Abel;</hi> The death of innocent <hi>Abel,</hi> ſayes <hi>Lyra,</hi> was a Figure of the death of this Lamb; And yet after all this, he was ſtill to be ſlain upon the Croſſe. So, this place was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared before, in Gods eternall preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; and yet Chriſt goes now to prepare it by his Death, and anon, by his Reſurrection; and after that, by his Aſcenſion into Heaven: By his Death he purchaſeth it, and payes the great price of our Redemption, and opens the gates of Heaven to us: The High Prieſt went into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum, not without blood;</hi> and this High Prieſt of ours by his owne <hi>blood</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:170480:106"/>muſt <hi>enter into the Holy place,</hi> and ſo obtain eternall redemption for us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.12. ſo having conquered Death by his Reſurrection, he then aſcends to take poſſeſſion of this Place for us; He is, <hi>Praecurſor pro nobis, Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>The forerunner is for us entred, even Jeſus, verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Initiavit nobis viam Novam,</hi> in the tenth of that Epiſtle; <hi>That New,</hi> that hitherto untrodden, <hi>way hath he conſecrated for us, and is entred into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelfe, now to appear in the preſence of God for us, Heb.</hi> 9.24. That's the laſt particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vobis, for you,</hi> God, whatſoever he doth he doth it for ſome end; a wiſe man is not lightly ſo little maſter of his actions, but he ſtill propounds to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſome end in every of them: now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the end intended muſt ſtill be the moſt perfect good, and all meaner ends muſt conduce to that laſt end, that beſt good, and becauſe God, in himſelf, is <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> the greateſt good that can be, and ſo could not poſſibly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his actions to any end better than himſelf, therefore, for himſelf, hath he done all things whatſoever he hath
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170480:107"/>done, <hi>univerſa propter ſemetipſum,</hi> Prov. 16.4. <hi>All things were created by him, and for him, Col.</hi> 1.16. for himſelf chiefly, but not for himſelf wholly: the firſt thing that he did for us, 'twas for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe too, for his owne glory; his owne glory is that <hi>finis ultimus,</hi> the maine, the utmoſt, the principal end of all his actions, and ſhould be of ours; his <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Predestination</hi> of us <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the faundation of the world;</hi> 'twas <hi>ad laudem gloriae, To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, Eph.</hi> 1.12. But there is a ſubordinate end too, by which his actions tend to the laſt end; and that's the benefit of that creature, which he made after his own image, the good of man: as in the firſt creation, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he made, was for man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made the world and all the other creatures before he made man, that they might be ready for his uſe; ſo, in that great work of re-creation, of redemption, all that he did, was for man, the very birth of his ſon (to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin there) for that the ſong of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly hoaſt was, <hi>Gloria in excelſis Deo, Glory to God in the higheſt;</hi> but not a

            <p>We muſt be prepared to do good, and to ſuffer evil, if occaſion requires, and it may conduce to his glory; that's one way more: When Chriſt ſpeaks of this Kingdome <hi>Luke</hi> 22. he thus deſcribes thoſe for whom it is deſign'd; firſt, <hi>Ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations, verſ.</hi> 28. and then, <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdome, verſ.</hi> 29.
